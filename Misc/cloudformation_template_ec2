Following are the required paramemters to define in the cloud formation template before creating stack. These parameters are as follows:

1- the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID the new EC2 instance will use;
2- the EC2 instance type
3- the VPC ID and subnet ID where the instance will be launched
4- at least one security group ID; and
5- an EC2 key pair name.


For this example, we will assume a key pair was already created and a security group ID is already known, prior to creating the EC2 instance.
### you can use any IDE or notepad te create cloudformation template, you need to save it with .yaml extesnion.


Step 1. When defining a CloudFormation template.
        
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  EC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-0cff7528ff583bf9a
      
                        
 Step 2. Once you complete the template, create the CloudFormation stack. This can be done by clicking on the Create stack button from the CloudFormation console.
 Step 3. Select the option Template is ready and Upload a template file.
 Step 3. Define the stack name and, if there is a parameters section in the template, specify those parameters.
 
 Once you create the stack, it will appear as CREATE_COMPLETE in the CloudFormation console.
