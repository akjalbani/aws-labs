========================
SSH SERVER CONFIGURATION
========================

# Create an Amazon Linux 2 t2.micro EC2 instance:

  - Add a "CUSTOM TCP, PORT 443" inbound traffic rule to the Security Group
  - Use a new or existing .pem key-pair for the initial connection/configuration

# Configure OpenSSH Server:

  - SSH into the instance using its public IP:
    - ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC IP>

  - Set a password for root user:
    - sudo su
    - passwd

  - Open the OpenSSH Server configuration file:
    - sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

  - Uncomment and/or change the following options:
    - Port 443
    - PermitRootLogin yes
    - PasswordAuthentication yes
    - AllowTcpForwarding yes

  - Save the configuration changes and reload the SSH daemon:
    - sudo systemctl restart sshd

  - Close the session and test the connection:
    - ssh root@<SSH SERVER PUBLIC IP> -p 443



==================================
ESTABLISH A PORT-FORWARDING TUNNEL
==================================

  - Start a new session, mapping a local port to a remote port (SSH, in this example) of another machine:
    - ssh -L localhost:9999:<TARGET PUBLIC IP>:22 root@<SSH SERVER PUBLIC IP> -p 443

  - If the connection succeeds, proceed to connect to the <TARGET PUBLIC IP> instance:
    - ssh -i my-key.pem username@localhost -p 9999
